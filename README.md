# Copilot Agents Dojo 🥋

<h1 align="center">🏯</h1>

**Your AI agents are untrained. Time to put them through the dojo.**

The canonical GitHub Copilot edition of the [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) methodology. Same mandatory workflow, same discipline, same self-improving loop — adapted for GitHub Copilot agents with auto-discovery via repo root, no marketplace needed, and `scripts/` for automated gates.

Drop `skills/` + `.github/copilot-instructions.md` into any repo root → Copilot agents auto-discover and enforce the full workflow.

Includes:
- **22 production skills** (6 core kata + 7 flow waza + 6 practical kumite + 3 meta dō)
- Mandatory **BRAINSTORM → PLAN → TDD → REVIEW → FINISH** pipeline
- Git worktree isolation
- Self-improving `tasks/lessons.md`
- `scripts/verify.sh` enforcement gates
- GitHub Actions PR enforcement

## The Mandatory Workflow

Every non-trivial task follows this pipeline — no skipping, no improvising:

```
BRAINSTORM → WORKTREE → PLAN → EXECUTE → TEST → REVIEW → FINISH → LEARN
```

| Step | Skill | What Happens |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | [`brainstorming`](skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md) | Socratic refinement → approved design |
| 2 | [`using-git-worktrees`](skills/using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md) | Isolated workspace on feature branch |
| 3 | [`plan-before-code`](skills/plan-before-code/SKILL.md) | Bite-sized tasks in `tasks/todo.md` |
| 4 | [`executing-plans`](skills/executing-plans/SKILL.md) | One task at a time, verify each |
| 5 | [`test-writing`](skills/test-writing/SKILL.md) | RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for every change |
| 6 | [`requesting-code-review`](skills/requesting-code-review/SKILL.md) | Self-review against plan |
| 7 | [`finishing-a-development-branch`](skills/finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md) | Verify + merge decision + cleanup |
| 8 | [`self-improvement`](skills/self-improvement/SKILL.md) | Log lessons, update metrics |

## Skill Sets

- **[`skills/`](skills/)** — Individual skill folders (kata + waza + kumite + dō)
- **[`agents/`](agents/)** — Specialized agent personas for different roles
- **[`skills.md`](skills.md)** — The master index — auto-discovered by Copilot agents
- **[`spec/`](spec/)** — The Copilot Skills specification
- **[`template/`](template/)** — Starter template for creating new skills

## Core Kata — 基本型

Behavioral skills that govern *how* agents think. Style-agnostic — works with any language or framework.

| Skill | Discipline |
|-------|-----------|
| [`plan-before-code`](skills/plan-before-code/SKILL.md) | 🥋 Plan multi-step work before touching code |
| [`subagent-strategy`](skills/subagent-strategy/SKILL.md) | 🥋 Delegate research, analysis, and testing to subagents |
| [`self-improvement`](skills/self-improvement/SKILL.md) | 🥋 Capture lessons, track patterns, evolve skills |
| [`verify-before-done`](skills/verify-before-done/SKILL.md) | 🥋 Prove your work with tests, logs, and diffs |
| [`demand-elegance`](skills/demand-elegance/SKILL.md) | 🥋 Challenge hacky solutions (but don't over-engineer) |
| [`autonomous-bug-fix`](skills/autonomous-bug-fix/SKILL.md) | 🥋 Reproduce → diagnose → fix → verify. Zero hand-holding. |

## Practical Kumite — 実践組手

Task-specific skills for common engineering workflows.

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [`code-review`](skills/code-review/SKILL.md) | Structured review with severity-based feedback |
| [`refactoring`](skills/refactoring/SKILL.md) | Safe refactoring — behavior preservation, small steps |
| [`test-writing`](skills/test-writing/SKILL.md) | Meaningful tests that catch bugs, not just exist |
| [`pr-workflow`](skills/pr-workflow/SKILL.md) | Clean commits, good descriptions, merge-ready PRs |
| [`debugging`](skills/debugging/SKILL.md) | Systematic debugging — evidence, hypotheses, divide-and-conquer |
| [`codebase-onboarding`](skills/codebase-onboarding/SKILL.md) | Rapidly understand unfamiliar codebases |

## Flow Waza — 流れ技

Skills that orchestrate the mandatory pipeline — brainstorm to finish.

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [`brainstorming`](skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md) | Socratic design refinement before any code |
| [`using-git-worktrees`](skills/using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md) | Isolated workspace for every session |
| [`executing-plans`](skills/executing-plans/SKILL.md) | Dispatch and execute tasks from `tasks/todo.md` |
| [`requesting-code-review`](skills/requesting-code-review/SKILL.md) | Self-review against plan between tasks |
| [`receiving-code-review`](skills/receiving-code-review/SKILL.md) | Process feedback and iterate |
| [`finishing-a-development-branch`](skills/finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md) | Final verification + merge decision + cleanup |
| [`dispatching-parallel-agents`](skills/dispatching-parallel-agents/SKILL.md) | Concurrent sub-agent work when beneficial |

## Meta Dō — 道

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [`skill-creator`](skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md) | Meta-skill for creating new dojo skills |
| [`writing-skills`](skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md) | SKILL.md template and spec compliance |
| [`using-superpowers`](skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md) | Framework activator — loads everything |

## Creating a Skill

Skills are simple — a folder with a `SKILL.md` containing YAML frontmatter and instructions:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill-name
description: >-
  Clear description of what this skill does and when the agent should
  use it. Be specific about trigger phrases and contexts.
---

# My Skill Name

Instructions the agent follows when this skill activates.

## When to Use
- Trigger condition 1

## How to Use
Step-by-step workflow.

## Examples
Concrete demonstrations.

## Anti-Patterns
What NOT to do.
```

See the full spec at [`spec/copilot-skills-spec.md`](spec/copilot-skills-spec.md) or use [`template/SKILL.md`](template/SKILL.md) as a starting point.

## Skill Anatomy

Each skill is a self-contained folder:

```
skills/my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Required — frontmatter + instructions
├── examples/         # Optional — worked examples
├── references/       # Optional — docs loaded on demand
└── scripts/          # Optional — executable helpers
```

Skills use progressive disclosure to manage context window budget:
1. **Metadata** (name + description) — Always in context
2. **SKILL.md body** — Loaded when skill activates
3. **Bundled resources** — Loaded on demand

### [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](/.github/copilot-instructions.md) — The Dojo Rules
The house rules that every agent follows when they enter your repo:

- Code standards — multi-stack examples (TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, .NET)
- Behavioral governance summary linking back to the skills
- Session-start lesson review workflow
- Helper script references for automation

## Specialized Agents

Agents are specialized personas bundled in the [`agents/`](agents/) directory. Each agent combines relevant skills to excel at specific roles:

| Agent | Focus Area |
|-------|-----------|
| [`architect.md`](agents/architect.md) | System design, technical strategy, and long-term architecture decisions |
| [`security-engineer.md`](agents/security-engineer.md) | Security compliance, vulnerability identification, and secure practices |
| [`software-engineer.md`](agents/software-engineer.md) | Feature development, bug fixes, and production-quality code |
| [`technical-program-manager.md`](agents/technical-program-manager.md) | Project planning, timeline coordination, and cross-team communication |
| [`test-engineer.md`](agents/test-engineer.md) | Test strategy, test implementation, and quality assurance |

Agents activate based on context and task type, dynamically loading the appropriate skills for the job.

## Helper Scripts

Reusable scripts in `/scripts/` to reduce token burn and enforce consistency:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| [`scripts/init.sh`](scripts/init.sh) | Scaffolds `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md` on first clone |
| [`scripts/lesson-updater.sh`](scripts/lesson-updater.sh) | Scans lessons for recurring patterns (3+), proposes skill amendments |
| [`scripts/verify.sh`](scripts/verify.sh) | Pre-PR verification: tests, clean tree, plan check |

```bash
# Initialize the dojo in your repo
bash scripts/init.sh

# Check for patterns that should become skills
bash scripts/lesson-updater.sh

# Verify before submitting a PR
bash scripts/verify.sh
```

## Automated Enforcement

The `.github/workflows/dojo-enforce.yml` GitHub Action runs on every PR to `main`:
- Checks that `tasks/todo.md` has a real plan (not the default template)
- Verifies `tasks/lessons.md` exists
- Validates helper scripts are present

## Self-Improvement Loop

Inspired by [cognee](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee)-style automation:

1. **Observe**: After every correction, log a structured lesson in `tasks/lessons.md` with YAML tags (error type, root cause, fix, rule).
2. **Store**: Lessons are tagged and queryable. Metrics track total lessons, recurring patterns, and amendment rate.
3. **Amend**: When a pattern hits 3+ occurrences, `scripts/lesson-updater.sh` proposes a rule update to `skills.md`.
4. **Evaluate**: Track pre/post-fix metrics in `tasks/lessons.md`. If a rule isn't working, revise it.
5. **Rollback**: Failed fixes get rolled back immediately. Failed rules get revised or removed.

## Why Train Your Agents?

Untrained agents:
- Rush in without a plan — all offense, no strategy
- Never learn from their losses
- Throw sloppy patches instead of finding the root cause
- Declare victory without proof
- Flood the context window like an undisciplined sparring partner

Trained agents operate like **seasoned black belts** — plan the approach, execute with precision, verify the outcome, learn from every round.

## Enter the Dojo

1. **Copy the `skills/` folder** into your repo — or pick individual skills you need
2. **Place `skills.md` at your repo root** — Copilot agents auto-discover this index and activate skills
3. **Place `.github/copilot-instructions.md`** in your `.github/` folder — customize for your stack
4. **Run `bash scripts/init.sh`** — scaffolds `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`
5. **Create custom skills** — Use `template/SKILL.md` or the `skill-creator` skill for your team's workflows

## Choose Your Fighting Style

The Code Standards in `copilot-instructions.md` ship with examples for multiple stacks:

- **TypeScript** 📘: strict mode, Vitest, Tailwind, Next.js App Router
- **Python** 🐍: pytest, Black, type hints, FastAPI/Django
- **Java** ☕: JUnit 5, Spring Boot, Maven/Gradle
- **Go** 🐹: standard library, table-driven tests
- **.NET** 🛡️: xUnit, clean architecture, nullable reference types

Pick your style. Delete the others. The Six Disciplines are **style-agnostic**.

## Origin Story

Built on the methodology from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) — the agentic skills framework that proved disciplined agents outperform freestyle ones. This repo is the canonical GitHub Copilot adaptation: same mandatory workflow, same enforcement rules, adapted for Copilot's auto-discovery (`skills/` + `.github/copilot-instructions.md` at repo root, no marketplace install needed) and `scripts/` for automated gates.

Agents will behave identically: disciplined, testable, self-improving, no hand-holding.
